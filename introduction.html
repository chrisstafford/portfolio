	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Hello.</p>
	<p>
		You're probably wondering what you're looking at. What the goal of this small site is, is to exhibit my portfolio while demonstrating some of
		the abilities on my resume. I've written the code for this page to resemble the practices used to build a web application (To the best of my
		ability when applying these practices to build a small portfolio site, of course.) 
	</p>
	<p>
		I invite you, at any point, to look at the source files listed below if you would like to take a better look at my work. While I can't promise 
		this will be the most entertaining portfolio, I believe you will get a good understanding of the caliber of my work. 
	</p>
	<p>	
		One of the first things you'll notice, I hope, is that there is not a lot of code. I believe that the less code there is, the less that can 
		go wrong, and also, the less amount of effort it takes to correct an issue should one occur. For example, if you were to right click and view 
		source on this page, you'd notice that there is only 28 lines of code. I would also like to point out that this page functions and displays 
		correctly in all current versions of web browsers and mobile browsers.
