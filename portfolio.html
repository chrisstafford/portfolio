<div id="partial">
	<h1>Portfolio</h1>
	<p>
		First, I would like to point out that if you were to look at the source for "portfolio.html" file, you'd notice that there are no list items.
		That's because all of the list items are being drawn from the JSON set in <a href="javascripts/data.js" class="new-window">javascripts/data.js</a> 
		file.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, I do not have the rights to give access to interlinkONE's core product to exhibit my back end development skills as a portfolio 
		item. However, I can however show you thumbnails and have descriptions of what was accomplished. Beneath the thumbs of the back end development
		you'll see the some of the front end development work I've accomplished
